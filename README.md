<h1>Yapi Kapi</h1>
	
<p>
	Yapi Kapi is a web application developed at Hack The Hearst - a hackathon conducted by Phoebe.A.Hearst Anthropology Museum, UC Berkeley. The hackathon had 170 registered teams, 30 of them made it to the final project displays. Yapi Kapi won the award for the 'Best Overall App' and the 'Best Heritage App'.

	The goal for the hackathon was to use the large online database of artifacts Yapi Kapi brings the museum's Native Californian collection to the K-12 classrooms. It engages the students with an interactive browsing experience. The students can look for artifacts using a polygon-search on the map, add their notes to an artifact and also favourite them. The teachers can manage class assignments and grade the students.
